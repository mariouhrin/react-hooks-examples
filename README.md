**Warning! Hook API is experimental and is going to change in the future. Please refer to [original documentation](https://reactjs.org/hooks).**

Hooks. People love them, people hate them. But one is for sure - hooks are there to stay and React ecosystem is going to evolve, again.

The most important feature of hooks is sharing _reusable functionality_. In the past it was achieved using _mixins_, which were later deprecated in favor of patterns like _render props_ and _higher order components_. But these patterns introduced additional complexity and resulted in something now called _wrapper hell_.

## What is this?

The purpose of this reposity is to provide beginner-friendly real-world examples of different hooks usage. Here are some of them:

* Accordion [[code](src/components/accordion), [demo](https://hooks-by-example.now.sh/accordion)]
* Todo list [[code](src/components/todo-list), [demo](https://hooks-by-example.now.sh/todo-list)]
* Form validation library [[code](src/components/form-library), [demo](https://hooks-by-example.now.sh/form-library)]
* Sortable [[code](src/components/sortable), [demo](https://hooks-by-example.now.sh/sortable)]
* Concurrent React experiments

This application is built using `create-react-app`, so feel free to clone the repo and play with examples yourself.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
